I was tasked with developing digital slides for an annual lights festival, themed around a mystical forest. The design process involved creating visually captivating slides that conveyed key information within a strict time limit of just 7 seconds per slide. To ensure each slide was impactful yet concise, I focused on balancing engaging visuals with clear text, ensuring the message was easy to absorb in the short duration. The design elements were carefully selected to reflect the enchanting atmosphere of the festival, with elements like glowing trees, magical creatures, and vibrant lighting effects, all enhancing the theme of the mystical forest. The final slides were refined for quick transitions, delivering a memorable and immersive experience for festival-goers.
