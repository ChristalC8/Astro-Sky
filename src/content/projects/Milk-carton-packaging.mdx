I was hired to design a unique milk carton for the ZENCO brand. I began by studying the provided design brief and evaluating all specifications. Extensive research on milk carton designs helped inspire the creative process, leading to the development of both 2-D thumbnail sketches and a 3-D mock-up.

The milk carton design features the ZENCO brand's logo, objectives, and essential content, all while staying within the projectâ€™s budget and timeline. This project demonstrates the creation of customised packaging solutions that meet client needs and adhere to industry standards.
