The Giga Café project centered on building a comprehensive brand identity for a modern café specialising in all-day breakfast, lunch, beverages, and a dedicated kid’s menu. The objective was to create an elegant yet modern design that resonates with its diverse audience, including families, workers, and the local community.  

I managed the entire development process for Giga Café, which included:  
- Logo Design: Crafting a distinctive logo with carefully chosen colour schemes and custom illustrations.  
- Menu design: The main attention was the layout. Ensuring it was readable and well-organised. While also adding an elegant style to their menu.
- Packaging Design: Creating innovative and appealing packaging to reflect the café's branding.  
- Social Media Artwork: Designing animated and illustrated content for social media campaigns.  
- Interior Artwork: Producing captivating illustrations and designs for display within the café.  
- Web Development: Giga Cafe has plans to introduce online ordering. This aims to provide customers with faster service and convenience. I designed and developed a responsive and user-friendly website. The web and mobile interfaces for Giga were thoughtfully developed using Adobe XD, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience across devices.
