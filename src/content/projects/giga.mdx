I was tasked with developing digital slides for an annual lights festival, themed around a mystical forest. The design process involved creating visually captivating slides that conveyed key information within a strict time limit of just 7 seconds per slide. I focused on balancing engaging visuals with clear text, ensuring the message was easy to absorb in the short duration. The advertisement was designed with a focus on access and inclusion, incorporating features such as wheelchair accessibility, audio options, and audio descriptions. The final slides were carefully refined to ensure smooth, quick transitions, creating a memorable and immersive experience for all festival-goers.
