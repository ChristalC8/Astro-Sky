This project focused on creating a brand identity for Giga Café, a modern café offering all-day breakfast, lunch, beverages, and a kid's menu. The aim was to design an elegant but modern style for the cafe. 
I began developing colour schemes as well as working on illustrations for their logo.

Menu design. The main attention was the layout. Ensuring it was readable and well-organised. While also adding an elegant style to their menu.

Website Development. Giga Cafe has plans to introduce online ordering. This aims to provide customers with faster service and convenience. 

Packaging Design. Branded takeaway packaging, including coffee cups, bags, and other materials.
