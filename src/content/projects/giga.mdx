This project focused on creating a brand identity for Giga Café, a modern café offering all-day breakfast, lunch, beverages, and a kid's menu. The aim was to craft an elegant, approachable style that appeals to workers, families, and the local community.  

# Project Highlights
Brand Identity Development
   Designed a modern logo that captures the café's inviting atmosphere.  

Menu Design  
   Developed a visually appealing, well-organised menu with clear typography to enhance readability and presentation. Particular attention was given to layout design to ensure that information was both accessible and engaging for customers.  

Website Development
   Created a concept for a website, tailored for Giga Café's plan to introduce online ordering. This feature aims to provide customers with faster service and the convenience of skipping the line.  

Packaging Design
   Designed branded takeaway packaging, including coffee cups, bags, and other materials.
