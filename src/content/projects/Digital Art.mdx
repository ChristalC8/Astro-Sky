I developed two custom digital artworks for a digital art gallery’s electronic newsletter, focusing on the growing crypto art scene. Using Photoshop’s animation features and generative fill, I incorporated vibrant vaporwave-inspired colours to represent the futuristic nature of crypto art. These designs are crafted to engage future clients, showcasing the intersection of technology and creativity within the crypto art world.
