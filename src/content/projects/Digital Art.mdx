I was tasked with creating two digital artworks for a digital art gallery’s electronic newsletter, focusing on the burgeoning crypto art scene. Drawing inspiration from the vaporwave aesthetic, I incorporated vibrant, futuristic colours to evoke the emerging world of digital art in the crypto space. The artworks were created using Photoshop, utilising its animation features and generative fill capabilities to add dynamic elements and enhance the glow effects. These designs are intended to capture the essence of crypto art, blending technology and creativity to engage the gallery’s future clients.
