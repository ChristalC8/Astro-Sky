This project features a custom book cover design for the thriller novel The Devil's Inn by Max Burgess. The cover art combines eerie visual elements with bold typography to capture the suspenseful and sinister atmosphere of the story.

The design process began with creating several initial illustrations and exploring creative concepts to align with the novel's themes. After careful consideration, the house illustration was chosen as the focal point. The next step involved digitising the artwork and developing a color scheme to complement and enhance the book's style and atmosphere.

The front cover features a dark, haunting forest and a broken down inn with glowing windows and ominous details, hinting at the supernatural forces within the narrative. The title, portrayed in a jagged red font, evokes a sense of danger, while the shadowy background intensifies the suspenseful mood. The spine and back cover continue the eerie aesthetic with a woodland silhouette and a captivating synopsis designed to entice potential readers.

This book cover design blends traditional illustration with modern digital techniques, delivering a polished, professional result that appeals to fans of horror and thriller genres.
