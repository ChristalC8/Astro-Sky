This project features a custom book cover for The Devil's Inn by Max Burgess, designed to capture the suspense of this thriller. Featuring eerie illustrations, bold typography, and a dramatic colour palette, the cover evokes mystery and danger.  

The design process involved creating several illustrations, which were then narrowed down to one. This was followed by digitising the artwork and selecting a colour palette that enhances the dark, atmospheric tone of the story. The final cover combines a shadowy forest, glowing inn windows, and a jagged red title, appealing to fans of horror and thrillers.
