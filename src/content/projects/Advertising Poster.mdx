This project focuses on creating a series of six original images that visually interpret a musical composition. The process began with sketching various approaches, followed by capturing photographs using a camera. The images were then refined, and one standout photo was selected as the 'hero' image. This image was transformed into a musical poster using advanced photo manipulation techniques, creating the illusion of a guitar submerged in an underwater world. Typography was carefully designed to engage potential visitors and encourage attendance. 

By blending photography, digital manipulation, and creative design, this project aims to evoke the emotions and atmosphere of the music while promoting the event.
