# About Me

Hi, I'm Christal.

I am graphic designer with a passion for branding, layout design, and packaging. I enjoy combining illustrative and photographic elements with typography to craft designs that captivate and engage.

I enjoy exploring creative ways to bring concepts to life, whether through clean, minimalistic layouts or dynamic abstract gradients.
From designing compelling layouts to creating versatile advertising campaigns, my goal is to deliver designs that are both visually impactful and purpose-driven.
